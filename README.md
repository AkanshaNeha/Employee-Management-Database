# Employee-Management-Database

Employees are the backbone of any company and their management system plays an important role in deciding the success of an organization. An employee database allows to store, manage and track all the employee data. It has a variety of employee personal data such as name, title, department, salary etc. It allows administrators to edit employees, add new employee, transfer/promote/terminate the employee. Each employee has a title and designation that can be easily repositioned with the help of a database. Most of all, the employees can assign tasks to employees and assess their progress in order to keep track of their performance. In this system we have 6 tables employee, title, departments, dept_manager, dept_emp and salaries.

**We have attributes like:**

**Employee:**	(emp_no, birth_date, first_name, last_name, gender, hire_date)

**Title:**		(emp_no, title, from_date, to_date)

**Departments:**	(dept_no, dept_name)

**Dept_manager:**	(dept_no, emp_no, from_date ,to_date)

**Dept_emp:**	(emp_no, dept_no, from_date, to_date)

**Salaries:**	(emp_no, salary, from_date, to_date)
